    Music
    
    Meaning- This function gives the detailed meaning of the word we give through voice as input. The voice assistant will ask for a word at first,after we've provided the word it'll ask us whether to give meaning for verb,adjective or noun of the given word (if all three are available for the given particular word),else if a word has only verb/adjective/noun it'll simply deliver the meaning for it.
    
    Synonym- This function is used to deliver the meaning of a word in short. We've to input a word to voice assistant then it'll deliver the synonym(both first&second) of the word we've asked for. If a word has only one synonym it'll deliver as it is.
    
    Antonym- This function delivers the antonym of the word we ask for. Same as synonym we,ve to input a word to voice assistant for which we need the synonym to be known it'll deliver the antonym(both first&second).If a word has not more than one synonym it'll display as it is.
    
    Pronunciation- This function provides us the exact pronunciation of the word which we input as voice to acolyte. We can even ask acolyte for the pronunciation of a word by giving the spellings for eg. To know the pronunciation of PENGUIN we can say P-E-N-G-U-I-N word by word and acolyte will deliver the exact pronunciation.
    
    Music- It'll play a music which we've specified from our desktop.
